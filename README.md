## Project Breakdown

### ← README.md

Do what it says and read it. It contains important information about remixing and other useful tips.

### ← index.html

This is the homescreen of the website. Put games and other files on another page by copying template.html and renaming the file to whatever you would like. For example, `newgame.html`

### ← style.css

Put CSS style rulings in this file to make the website look prettier.

### ← script.js

It's a ghost town in this file. All that is in it are logs for debugging.

### ← assets

Drag in `assets`, like logos or shockwave flash files into here to upload flash games. To use embed, copy the link to the file in `assets`. DO NOT USE THE FILENAME!

### ← .env

If you would like to see or use some of these keys or files you can contact me at BlackHexFury896@protonmail.com. Make sure you mention why you are emailing or I may just delete the email.
